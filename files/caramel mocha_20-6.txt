intitial results:
	great flavor, tastes like coffee for sure! the wick has still yet to set entirely. I'm going to prime it manually by dripping a couple more drops directly to the coil. Yep, That's definately caramel mocha flavored. Fuck, Yes. Twinkie, I feel, Would be an excellent addition to this mix. Or, sweetner. Can't decide. Can, get decent cloudage and the PG adds to the robust flavor from the coffee and the PG/VG mix must be pretty balanced as i can also get the sweeter notes from the caramel, and the chocolate tastes rubustly sweet as well. A great start to this tank! I'm excited.

cotton has set:
	The sweetness is prime. The rubustness is not sub-prime either. An excellent experience.
