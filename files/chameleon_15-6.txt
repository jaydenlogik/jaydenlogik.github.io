COMMENTS:This flavor is slowly starting to grow on me. I really don't know how to describe the flavor. It's sweet and maybe it kind of blends with the flavor that's on my pallete really well in the sense that anything i'm eating or drinking "goes along with the flavor". If I were to compare it to a cigarette, I would say that it is a turkish royal silver :) Though, it is not a tobacco flavor at all.

Profile: The beginning flavor is a clean tart. The exhale is almost a mango-tangeriene/cream/sweetener flavor. It really holds up to the name. At first I wasn't really a fan of this flavor. But, throughout my day it's really difficult to put this flavor down. It really goes with anything that is already on my tongue. And, in that: This is a very unique flavor. I'm glad I gave this one a shot. My first 10ml are about half way through, and i'm wondering if anything can even replace it. chame-chame-chame-chame-chameleE3eo0n!
