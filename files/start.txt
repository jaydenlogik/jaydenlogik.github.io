READ.ME
All flavors are owned by me, and are purchased via centralvapors.com.
The flavor content is unknown to me and is property of centralvapors.com. And, I'm guessing is copyrighted to all holy, and delicious hell.
CentralVapers.com Is an excellent way to get started mixing your own juices!!! I, however, other than the products being used, am in no way directly nor indirectly associated with the company, Central Vapors. I am not paid to do any of this. (I only feel obligated to say this because this will be publicly accessible at one point in time.) Thank you for proofreading my meticulously detailed and helpful notepad of every flavor available from said website. I love them. Please tell them the engagement ring is in the works ;)
